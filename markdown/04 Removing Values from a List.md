# Removing Values from a List
---

There are many ways to remove values from a list, we will be exploring most of them. 

With removal, there are a lot of dangerous situations that can occur. It is advised to understand each technique before thinking about value removals.

### Removal by a Target Value

```.remove(target)``` method will remove the __first occurance__ of the targetted value if it exists in the list.

If the target_value doesnâ€™t exist, it will produce an __error__.


```python
# .remove() example

a_list = ['apple', 'oranges', 'kiwi', 'honeydew', 'apple']
a_list.remove('apple')
a_list.remove('kiwi')

print('a_list:', a_list)
```

    a_list: ['oranges', 'honeydew', 'apple']


### Removal by Index

```.pop(target_index)``` will remove a value located at the ```target_index``` and __RETURN THE VALUE__.
- If the target_index goes beyond the list size, it will produce an error.
- ```pop()``` without an target index returns and removes the last value


```python
# .pop() example

a_list = ['apple', 'oranges', 'kiwi', 'honeydew', 'apple']
removed1 = a_list.pop()
a_list.pop(2)


print('a_list:', a_list)
print('removed1:', removed1)
```

    a_list: ['apple', 'oranges', 'honeydew']
    removed1: apple


### Removing All Items in a List

```.clear()``` is a method that will empty out its list.


```python
# .clear() example

a_list = ['apple', 'oranges', 'kiwi', 'honeydew', 'apple']
a_list.clear()

print('a_list:', a_list)
```

    a_list: []


### Introduction to ```del```

```del``` is used to delete objects in Python. _The concepts of "objects" are discussed in a future course!_

_```del``` can delete an entire instance of a list_


```python
# del example 1

a_list = ['apple', 'oranges', 'kiwi', 'honeydew', 'apple']
del a_list

print('a_list:', a_list)
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-5-eb3269d4b4cb> in <module>
          4 del a_list
          5 
    ----> 6 print('a_list:', a_list)
    

    NameError: name 'a_list' is not defined


Notice that since the variable was deleted, we get an error say that the ```a_list``` was never created.

_```del``` can delete a single item in a list by indexing_


```python
# del example 2

a_list = ['apple', 'oranges', 'kiwi', 'honeydew', 'apple']
del a_list[1]
del a_list[-1]

print('a_list:', a_list)
```

    a_list: ['apple', 'kiwi', 'honeydew']


There are no errors here since we are only deleting single items from the list.

_```del``` can delete via slicing_


```python
# del example 3

a_list = ['apple', 'oranges', 'kiwi', 'honeydew', 'apple']
del a_list[0:3]

print('a_list:', a_list)
```

    a_list: ['honeydew', 'apple']


Notice that the first three items were deleted from a_list.

## MAJOR DANGER: Deletion During Iteration

It is very common for beginner programmers to _delete while iterating the targeted list_.

__Observe:__


```python
# Example of bad practice

a_list = ['apple', 'oranges', 'kiwi', 'honeydew', 'apple']
for value in a_list:
    if value == 'kiwi':
        a_list.remove(value)
    
    print('value is currently:', value)
print('-'*64)

print('a_list:', a_list)
```

    value is currently: apple
    value is currently: oranges
    value is currently: kiwi
    value is currently: apple
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    a_list: ['apple', 'oranges', 'honeydew', 'apple']


__Explanation:__
- The print statement inside the iteration prints 'kiwi'
- The print statement of 'kiwi' should have been impossible since 'kiwi' was deleted
- This happens because _a for loop never re-checks the value of a_list_

__Recommendations:__
1. Use while loops and index-based deletion
2. Make a copy of the list, execute deletion on the copy
